# REACT/REDUX

Next experiment of use React, in isomorphic envoirement. Now try to use it with relay.

You could use express or koa, by default uses koa, becoses need yield untill done.

Need relay.

First install:
```bash
npm i
```

Then run:

```bash

npm start
```
An you can view in browser by
[http://localhost:8001](http://localhost:8001)

Include [bootstrap-sass](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass), at the head of the server, after parser as css.

Generate code by webpack for client and server. Becose that only can parse .scss into code.

Implements Redux, as reducer data
